## Challenges and Learnings

Working on this project was a defining moment in my web development journey. It was my first real-world capstone project, started immediately after completing my Next.js course on Udemy, and it pushed me far beyond simply following tutorials.

I applied everything I had learned up to that point - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, PostgreSQL - and quickly realized that building a complete application involves more than just writing code. It’s about integrating multiple technologies and ensuring they work seamlessly together to deliver a smooth experience for the end user.

This project was also my first time:

- Designing a web app with the client’s experience as the core priority.

- Integrating Lucia Auth for authentication and truly understanding how cookies work differently between localhost and secure HTTPS environments.

- Hosting an app of any sort by hosting this Next.js app on Vercel and managing a PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon.

- Deploying a fully functional app for real-world use, which taught me the importance of environment variables, deployment pipelines, and security best practices.

One of my biggest takeaways is that web development is not just about knowing how to code - it’s about solving real problems by combining tools, frameworks, and services in creative ways. Hosting and deployment, in particular, showed me that the ability to connect the dots between technologies is what turns an idea into something people can actually use.

Above all, this project gave me the confidence that I can take an idea from concept to a live, working product - and that’s an empowering feeling I’ll carry into every project I build from here on. I cannot wait to turn my next idea into reality. ILoveCoding💕
